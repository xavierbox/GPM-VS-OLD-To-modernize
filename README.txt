[Commit: Managed to compile the code. Original version. Backup copy]
 This is a backup copy of the code to improve and modernize. 

[Commit: missing files removed, GPMAPI still not added.]
 The GPMAPI copy is still missing. 
 Same for some old sources that may not be needed afterall. 
 This is to be confirmed with the developers once the azure repo is available
